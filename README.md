Repository for the Web User Interface to the KNoT Gateway based on angular and bootstrap.

To run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Server will be available at port 8080 on localhost.

First use:

1. Click on `create account` link to register a new KNoT user account.

2. Fill up the sign up fields and the interface will recognize that there is no cloud settings and will redirect you to a setup page.

3. Fill up with your cloud IP and port. Alternatively, you can use the KNoT cloud default IP address (54.175.32.51), or if you do not want to connect to a cloud, just fill with 'localhost' and '3000' for IP and port respectively.

4. Now it is possible to continue with the sign up and sign in.
